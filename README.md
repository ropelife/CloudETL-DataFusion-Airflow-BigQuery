# CloudETL: A Scalable ETL Pipeline with Data Fusion, Airflow, and BigQuery

This project is designed to seamlessly orchestrate the movement of data through various stages, ensuring both efficiency and security:

1) Data Collection: Utilize Python for efficient data extraction from diverse sources.
2) Data Protection: Implement advanced data masking and encoding techniques within Cloud Data Fusion to safeguard sensitive information.
3) Data Integration: Load the transformed and secured data into Google BigQuery tables for further analysis and processing.
4) Automated Workflow: Leverage Airflow (Cloud Composer) to automate the end-to-end data pipeline, ensuring reliability and scalability.

Developed using Python, Google Cloud Storage, Cloud Data Fusion, Google BigQuery, Apache Airflow
